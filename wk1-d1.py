# Summer of code Notes
# Week 1 day 1
# First simple arithmetic exercises

# print(3)

# print(1+2)

# print(1+2)

# print(2*3)
# first error message! Indentationerror: unexpected indent

# print(5-8)
# second error message. Indentationerror: unexpected indent again :|

# print(9/2)

# print(5 * (12-8) + -15)
# print(98 + (59872 / (13*8)) * -51)

# modulus: gives you the remainder after division
# print(10 % 2)

# power and bitshift
# credit: alteredco "mathletes"
# print(2**8)
# print(1<<9)

# Basic homework exercises for certification:
# I'm on the DIY track but I'll do as much as I can anyway

# Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
# print(24*365)

# Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
# minutes in an day:
# print(60*24)
# = 1440
# minutes in a year:
# print(1440*365) 
# first try just got the prompt back - I forgot to uncomment!
# The answer: 525600 minutes in a year
# minutes in a decade:
# print(525600*10)
# = 5256000
# seconds in a day
# print(1440*60)
# = 86400


# Extra questions:
# Seconds in a decade:
# print(5256000*60)
# 315360000
# How many minutes in a leap year: 
# print(525600+1440)
# = 527040
# How many seconds in a leap year:
# print(527040*60)
# 31622400

# My age in seconds:
# print(315360000*6)
# = 1892160000
# print(31*5)
# = 155
# print(30*2)
# = 60
# print(155+60)
# = 215
# print (215*1440)
# = 309600
# print(309600*60)
# = 18576000
# print(18576000-86400)
# = 18489600
# print(18489600-600)
# = 18489000
# print(1892160000-18489000)
# = 1873671000 My age in seconds!




# This was the first go where I did it a different way.
# Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)
# print(525600*58)
# = 30484800
# FullyQualifiedErrorId: CommandNotFound Exception
# I accidently put a dot between python and calc.py
# print(1440*16)
# = 23040
# print(30484800+23040)
# = 30507840
# print(1440*31)
# = 44640
# print(1440*30)
# oops! I typed in just python and got >>>
# I tried  >>> calc.py and got Traceback (most recent 
# call last): File"<stdin", line 1. in <module>
# NameError: name 'calc' is not defined
# >>> python calc.py
# File "<stdin>", line 1

# Finally!

# Andreea Visanoiu: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha.  Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.

# Here are some tougher questions:

# How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to
# timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?

# ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem

# How about a 64-bit system?
# Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday 
#(maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use # 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules.
